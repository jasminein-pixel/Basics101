# Basics 101

This is the repository for Workshop Basics 101. Basically, the code that we have been taught in the class is uploaded here. I have provided the code of sum of two numbers (frontend and backend). I have showed them how to connect them and stuff. More code will be uploaded here later.
Why this repository exists

The main reason for creating this repository is to learn the basics of Git flow. It is not recommended to create a PR in big repositories like Express directly. That is the reason this repository exists here, so you can practice without worry.

## What you must do

If you are attending the course, there is one must thing that a student should do:

    Fork this repository.

    Clone the forked repository.

    Add your name in CONTRIBUTORS.md file.

    Add, commit, and push.

    Create a PR.

## Optional Code Changes

If you are interested only or if you think you want to try something new, then this is it.

For example, here is sum of two numbers. You can try to add like three numbers. Yeah, try to add three numbers. Using AI is generally not recommended for this. This is not a must to change in the code. You don't have to necessarily change the code.
